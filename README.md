# SubdModeling
The scripts I used/wrote for modeling subduction of the asthenosphere in Semple and Richards 2022.
These are ipython notebook scripts that can be run out-of-box with the Underworld2 Docker. Underworld2 information can be found here: https://www.underworldcode.org/. These scripts are modified from the Underworld2 freely subducting slab exercise.

This catalog of scripts is seperated by the starting thickness of the asthenosphere, as described in the paper. Subsequent file names include abbreviated variable names and their values in sequence. For example: AccuVisc1-mua1E19mum20u60ha2rho02 is the 1st test of the viscous accumulation of asthenophere with viscosity of asthenophere (mua) = 1E19Pas, viscosity of mantle (mum) = 1E20, plate velocity (u) = 0.06m/yr, Asthenosphere thickness (ha) = 200km, and density contrast between asthenosphere and mantle of 2%.

Scripts should take from 3-7 days each to run on an average laptop.
